## Natural Language Processing Projects  
This repository contains all the projects and algorithm implementations related to the field of NLP (Natural Language Processing)

#### 1. Factoid Based Question Answering Chatbot
- This chatbot is a more simplistic version of a question answering systems developed utilizing a subset of SQuAD(Stanford Question Answering Dataset).
- The chatbot utilizes information retrieval and natural language processing techniques to provide answers to the user query for topics such as Marvel Comics and Modern History.

#### 2. The Porter Stemming Algorithm
- The implementation is based on the paper [Stemming Algorithm Paper](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/def.txt)

#### 3. POS Tagger Using Hidden Markov Models
- Using the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library built a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf)
